# mspacman-py

Just learn one thing at a time

## Background

I started on https://github.com/dleehr/mspacman-snes to build a homebrew port of Ms. Pac-Man for SNES. I didn't know 65816 assembly, the SNES hardware, or have much experience with game programming when I started. I got some basics working but it was frustrating. I figured I'd be better off If I worked it out in Python first, so here we are.

I already had some python scripts to load my text files for pixel maps and such. And after just a couple days, this version is at parity with what I had on SNES. Quicker debug loop too while I'm learning things.
